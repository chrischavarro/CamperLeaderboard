# Camper Leaderboard

This is a small beginner project I made using React as a FreeCodeCamp requirement.

### What does it do?

It provides a list of the most active FreeCodeCamp users within the past 30 days and offers a view of the most active users of all time.

#### What else do I have to know?
This project was created with Stephen Grider's ReduxSimpleStarter as a base - see LICENSE.MD for details.
